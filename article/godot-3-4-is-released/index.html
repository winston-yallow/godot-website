Such use-after-free access needs to be guarded with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_instance_valid(obj)</code>, but this has been surprisingly difficult to get right due to a number of bugs and inconsistencies between <em>debug</em> and <em>release</em> builds.<p>Pedro J. Estébanez (<a href=https://github.com/RandomShaper>RandomShaper</a>) has become an expert on this topic and made a number of improvements included in <a href=/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-2-2#dangling-variant>Godot 3.2.2</a> and <a href=/article/godot-3-3-has-arrived#deleted-objects-debug>Godot 3.3</a>. With this new change, the checks which were already performed in <em>debug</em> builds have been <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/51796>promoted to also run in <em>release</em> builds</a>, solving a discrepancy which was the source of much trouble for Godot users. This has a theoretical performance cost for release builds, but it was found not to be significant.<p><a id=large-files></a><h4 id=large-files-support--20-gib>Large files support (> 2.0 GiB)</h4><p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File</code> API can now manipulate files larger than 2.0 GiB, including PCK files, which used to be a limiting factor for bigger games.
Everything has been refactored to used unsigned 64-bit integers, which means that Godot now supports loading files of up to 8.4 million TiB… which should be sufficient for the foreseeable future.<p>Pedro started this work in <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/27247>2019</a>, and Rémi Verschelde (<a href=https://github.com/akien-mga>Akien</a>) <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47254>updated it</a> for the 3.4 release to match the core contributors’ consensus.<p><a id=delta-smoothing></a><h4 id=frame-delta-smoothing>Frame delta smoothing</h4><p>Currently, frame deltas are measured by sampling the OS clock, which can be subject to considerable random variations. Even when frames are being consistently displayed precisely at the vsync rate, these input timings can throw off object positions. <a href=https://github.com/lawnjelly>lawnjelly</a> added an option for <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48390>frame delta smoothing</a> that detects when Godot is hitting vsync consistently, and replaces the sampled input time with the fixed vsync delta. This can significantly improve the fluidity of motion and give smoother gameplay. This option is enabled by default, but can be turned off if you experience timing-related issues with your projects.<p>Another option was added to <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48555>sync frame delta after draw</a>, which is disabled by default. It may lead to more consistent deltas and further reduce frame stutters for some games.<p>Manuel Moos (<a href=https://github.com/zmanuel>zmanuel</a>) also implemented a fix for occasional <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/35617>negative frame deltas</a> due to getting out of sync with the OS clock.<p><a id=input></a><h4 id=improved-input-handling>Improved input handling</h4><p><a href=https://github.com/bruvzg>bruvzg</a> added support for <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46764>physical keys</a> in the keyboard InputEvents. Physical keys are a way to map the position of a key based on a standard US QWERTY keyboard layout, so that the same location can be used even when the player’s keyboard layout is different. For example mapping movements keys to WASD using physical keys will automatically remap them to ZQSD on a French AZERTY keyboard (where W and Z, and Q and A, are swapped). This makes it easier to support multiple keyboard layouts.<p>To simplify some of the most common constructs in input handling code for character movement, Aaron Franke (<a href=https://github.com/aaronfranke>aaronfranke</a>) added <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/50788>two new helper methods</a>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Input.get_axis()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Input.get_vector()</code>. These methods allow simplifying code like this:<div class="language-gdscript highlighter-rouge"><div class=highlight><pre class=highlight><code><span class=k>var</span> <span class=n>walk</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=n>WALK_FORCE</span> <span class=o>*</span> <span class=p>(</span><span class=n>Input</span><span class=o>.</span><span class=n>get_action_strength</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s2>"move_right"</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=o>-</span> <span class=n>Input</span><span class=o>.</span><span class=n>get_action_strength</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s2>"move_left"</span><span class=p>))</span>

Godot can now save and load public keys, sign and verify a hash with a RSA key, and encrypt and decrypt RSA keys.<p>Jon Bonazza (<a href=https://github.com/jonbonazza>jonbonazza</a>) and <a href=https://github.com/tavurth>tavurth</a> respectively implemented and <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48869>backported HMAC support</a> in the crypto API via a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HMACContext</code>.

Although raster (pixel based) occlusion culling will not be available until Godot 4, some geometrical occlusion methods are being added to Godot 3.<p>Thanks to lawnjelly, Godot 3.4 introduces <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46130>portal occlusion culling</a>, which is a tried and tested occlusion solution that has been used in many games, but does require some manual setup of the scene. As well as performing occlusion culling it also provides a solution for throttling AI and processing based on proximity to the viewer.</p><video autoplay loop>
<source src=/storage/app/media/3.4/portal-occlusion.mp4 type=video/mp4></video><p>In addition the ability to add simple geometrical occluders to scenes is being rolled out, starting with spherical occluders which are available in 3.4.<p><a id=aces-fitted-tonemapping></a><h4 id=aces-fitted-tonemapper>ACES Fitted tonemapper</h4><p>Godot 3.4 adds a new <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52477>ACES Fitted tonemapper option</a> contributed by Endri Lauson (<a href=https://github.com/Lauson1ex>Lauson1ex</a>) that allows scenes to look more realistic, such as by correctly handling the contrast of bright objects. You can try it out in the <a href=https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/678>Third Person Shooter (TPS) demo</a> which has been updated to use the ACES Fitted tonemapper.</p><video autoplay loop>

</code></pre></div></div><p>AudioWorklet was implemented for multi-threaded builds in Godot 3.3, solving issues with audio playback. But not all browsers or Web games platforms provide support for the necessary multi-threading APIs yet, so for single-threaded exports, <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52650>AudioWorklet was also implemented as a non-threaded option</a>. Performance is not the best, but it’s better than stuttering audio as users might experience on Chrome due to their deprecation of the previous standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ScriptProcessorNode</code> approach.<p><a id=macos></a><h4 id=macos-mono-universal-build-gdnative-framework-notarization>macOS: Mono universal build, GDNative Framework, notarization</h4><p>Thanks to an update of our Mono version to 6.12.0.158 (Preview), macOS builds can now target Apple Silicon too, so the macOS Mono builds are now also universal builds (both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arm64</code> support).<p>bruvzg also added support for using <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46860>macOS <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.frameworks</code> libraries with GDNative</a>, and in-editor integration for the <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49276>Apple notarization process</a> (only available when exporting <strong>to</strong> macOS <strong>from</strong> macOS).<p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7645683/84271035-3c81a580-ab34-11ea-934f-eda54037f45e.png alt="Notarization settings"><p><a id=physics></a><h3 id=physics>Physics</h3><p>Thanks to the work of multiple dedicated contributors, many improvements and fixes have been done in both 2D and 3D physics. It can’t be all detailed here, but here’s a list of the ones that have the most impact on usability and performance.<p><a id=kinematic-body></a><h4 id=kinematicbody-improvements-in-2d-and-3d>KinematicBody improvements in 2D and 3D</h4><p>While character controllers are being reworked for Godot 4.0 to be more reliable and much easier to use out-of-the-box, some major improvements and fixes have been also added to the 3.4 release:<ul><li>Better handling of moving platforms thanks to <a href=https://github.com/fabriceci>fabriceci</a>: <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/50166>GH-50166</a>.<li>Improved RayShape stability in Godot Physics 2D/3D: <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/53453>GH-53453</a>.<li>Various improvements for floor stability in Godot Physics 2D/3D.</ul><p><a id=convex-hull-generation></a><h4 id=faster-and-more-reliable-convex-hull-generation>Faster and more reliable convex hull generation</h4><p>Morris Arroad (<a href=https://github.com/mortarroad>mortarroad</a>) has worked on using a more reliable algorithm from Bullet to generate physics convex hulls from meshes. It’s now several times faster in complex cases, and has generally better results: <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48533>GH-48533</a>.<p>On top of that, thanks to the common work of Camille Mohr-Daurat (<a href=https://github.com/pouleyKetchoupp>pouleyKetchoupp</a>), <a href=https://github.com/jitspoe>jitspoe</a> and <a href=https://github.com/lawnjelly>lawnjelly</a> there’s now an option to generate a simplified convex hull from complex meshes, in order to make a convex hull that’s better for performance, at the cost of losing a bit of accuracy.<p>Example original mesh (40K vertices):

<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1075032/124838823-79d58400-df3c-11eb-8515-fe8775930353.PNG alt="Simplified convex hull (56 vertices)"><p><a id=collision-layer-grid></a><h4 id=revamped-collision-layer-grid-in-the-inspector>Revamped collision layer grid in the inspector</h4><p>The <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/51040>layer grid widget</a> has been improved to be more readable and support up to 32 collision layers in physics.<p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1075032/127698216-a7155488-52b6-45bf-8ff6-9495e8b0d4e1.png alt="Layer grid widget with 32 layers"><p><a id=bvh-physics-2d></a><h4 id=dynamic-bvh-for-godot-physics-2d>Dynamic BVH for Godot Physics 2D</h4><p>Based on the most part on the work <a href=https://github.com/lawnjelly>lawnjelly</a> already did <a href=https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-3-has-arrived#dynamic-bvh>for 3D</a>, <a href=https://github.com/pouleyKetchoupp>pouleyKetchoupp</a> has added support for using a dynamic BVH for the broadphase in 2D physics: <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48314>GH-48314</a>.<p>Like the 3D version, it generally has better performance and is more reliable, but it’s still possible to switch back to the old HashGrid in project settings if needed.<p><a id=godot-physics-3d></a><h4 id=improvements-and-new-features-in-godot-physics-3d>Improvements and new features in Godot Physics 3D</h4><p>While Godot Physics 3D is being worked on to become the default physics engine in 4.0, new features and improvements are backported to 3.x when possible.<p>That includes:<ul><li>Support for <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47349>HeightMap shapes</a> with the same optimizations as in Bullet thanks to the work of Marc Gilleron (<a href=https://github.com/Zylann>Zylann</a>).<li>Support for <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49446>Sync to Physics</a>.<li>Various fixes for RigidBody and KinematicBody.</ul><p><img src=/storage/app/media/godot-heightmap.gif alt="HeightMap shape in the Godot Physics engine"><p><a id=assets></a><h3 id=assets-pipeline>Assets pipeline</h3><p><a id=gltf-exporter></a><h4 id=export-3d-scenes-as-gltf>Export 3D scenes as glTF</h4><p>The glTF module authored by Ernest Lee (<a href=https://github.com/fire>fire</a> for Godot 4.0 was <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49120>backported to the 3.x branch</a> by lyuma. The biggest feature this adds is the ability to export scenes as glTF. This means you can build a scene in Godot using your favorite tools such as CSG, and then bring all of the mesh data into other 3D applications such as Blender or other Godot versions.<p><a id=lossless-webp></a><h4 id=lossless-webp-encoding>Lossless WebP encoding</h4><p>WebP is a new image format that can replace both JPEG and PNG. It has both lossy and lossless modes which are much more optimized than JPEG and PNG, it has a faster decompression time and a smaller file size compared to PNG. Godot already used WebP for lossy compression, and Godot 3.4 now <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47835>defaults to using it for lossless texture compression</a> instead of PNGs, thanks to work from Morris Arroad (<a href=https://github.com/mortarroad>mortarroad</a>). The importer time might be slightly increased, but the imported file sizes and loading times are <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47835#issuecomment-818573160>significantly reduced</a>.<p>For existing projects, you may want to delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">res://.import</code> folder to force a reimport of all lossless compressed textures using WebP. PNG is still supported, and can be enforced as the default via an option.<p><a id=editor></a><h3 id=editor>Editor</h3><p><a id=theme-editor></a><h4 id=revamped-ui-theme-editor>Revamped UI theme editor</h4><p>Godot provides an extensive system for customizing the looks of UI nodes, but until this point the tools for that were lacking ease of use and kept some users away from a really cool feature. To address multiple concerns and suggestions Yuri Sizov (<a href=https://github.com/pycbouh>pycbouh</a>) worked on overhauling the editor tools for theming and skinning. The new theme editor aims to make it as straightforward as possible to adjust your control nodes. You have improve listing of available properties that can be easily overridden for your project. A control picker allows to visually select the node you want to customize right from the preview panel. You can have custom previews from the scenes that make sense for your project. Styleboxes of the same type can be edited together to save you time adjusting their margins and borders. And theming power users can enjoy a new item management dialog that gives a lot of granularity when doing bulk adjustments to Theme resources.<p>Take a look at the new theme editor in action in this GDQuest video:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3AGGBZVVVTw title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a id=localized-classref></a><h4 id=localized-class-reference>Localized class reference</h4><p>Rémi implemented support for localizing the in-editor class reference back in <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/37164>March 2020</a> for 4.0, and finally decided to <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/53511>backport the new feature</a> (and first round of <a href=https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-class-reference/>community-authored translations</a>) for 3.4.<p>Godot 3.4 includes class reference translations for Chinese (Simplified) and Spanish with a high rate of completion. French, Japanese, and German also have translations included, but only for a subset of the API. Everyone is welcome to <a href=https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-class-reference/>participate in the translation effort</a>, so that future releases can include more languages and more translated content.<p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4701338/136363092-1c43444d-388e-4f33-b44e-073490fce769.jpg alt="Class reference localized in Chinese (Simplified)"><p><a id=editor-usability></a><h4 id=general-usability-improvements>General usability improvements</h4><p>The 3.4 release has a <em>huge</em> focus on editor usability. Those are changes which are for the most part independent of the big core, rendering and scripting changes in the 4.0 branch, and can therefore be backported relatively easily.
Here’s a short selection of some highlights:<ul><li><a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/37228>Use QuickOpen to load resources in the inspector</a><li><a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/51166>Rationalize property reversion</a><li><a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/50242>Allow to create a node at specific position</a><li><a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/50531>New export templates manager</a><li><a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/50528>Make several actions in the Inspector dock more obvious</a><li><a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/50597>Improve the 3D editor manipulation gizmo</a><li><a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48572>Improve the animation bezier editor</a><li>And more! Search “editor” <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/3.4-stable/CHANGELOG.md#34---2021-10-05>in the changelog</a>.</ul><p><a id=other-areas></a><h3 id=other-areas>Other areas</h3><p><a id=animation-reset></a><h4 id=animation-reset-track>Animation “reset” track</h4><p>One of the most common hurdles when using AnimationPlayer is that editing animations will permanently modify the state of your scene. To avoid this, users had to manually undo changes to all properties modified by the animation.<p>Now the resetting process can be automated, with the addition of a <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44558>RESET animation feature</a> thanks to Pedro. The RESET animation can be automatically added to AnimationPlayer and whenever a new keyframe is inserted for the first time, its value will also be mirrored in the RESET track as a default value. Upon scene save, affected properties are automatically saved with their default values, so editing animation no longer affects what is saved in your scene.</p><video autoplay loop>

Even if not listed here, every contribution makes Godot better, and this release is truly the work of hundreds of individuals working together towards a common goal and passion.<p>For more details on other changes in Godot 3.4, please consult our <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/3.4-stable/CHANGELOG.md#34---2021-10-05>curated changelog</a>, as well as the raw changelog from Git (<a href=https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/Godot_v3.4-stable_changelog_chrono.txt>chronological</a>, or sorted <a href=https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/Godot_v3.4-stable_changelog_authors.txt>by authors</a>).<h2 id=reporting-issues>Reporting issues</h2><p>Godot is a complex piece of software and is not bug-free. Our contributors do their best to fix issues as they are being reported, but there’s a lot of surface to cover and you might encounter situations which we aren’t aware of yet, or couldn’t fix in time for this release. There will be 3.4.x maintenance releases focused on fixing bugs in coming weeks and months, so make sure to <a href=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues>report any issue you encounter on GitHub</a>, so that we can make sure to fix it for our future releases.<h2 id=giving-back>Giving back</h2><p>As a community effort, Godot relies on individual contributors to improve. In addition to becoming a <a href=https://patreon.com/godotengine>Patron</a>, please consider giving back by: writing high-quality bug reports, contributing to the code base, writing documentation, writing tutorials (for the docs or on your own space), and supporting others on the various <a href=https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/channels.html>community platforms</a> by answering questions and providing helpful tips.<p>Last but not least, making games with Godot and crediting the engine goes a long way to help raise its popularity, and thus the number of active contributors who make it better on a daily basis. Remember, we are all in this together and Godot requires community support in every area in order to thrive.<p><a href=/download>Now go and have fun with 3.4!</a></div></div></article></div><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/css/anchor-link.css?1><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/css/article-cards.css?2><script src=/assets/js/anchor-link.js></script>
