We expect about 75 attendees, so this should be a great event!<p>As usual, this GodotCon will follow the <a href=https://fosdem.org/2020/>FOSDEM</a> which also takes place in Brussels, and where we’ll have a <a href=https://fosdem.org/2020/stands/>Godot stand</a> as well as a few Godot-related talks in the <a href=https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/game_development/>Game Development devroom</a> which some of us co-organize. Namely: <a href=https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/gamedev_python_for_godot/>Python for Godot</a> by Emmanuel Leblond, <a href=https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/benefits_porting_godot_engine_vulkan/>Benefits of porting Godot Engine to Vulkan</a> by Juan Linietsky, and <a href=https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/gamedev_reloading_escoria/>Reloading Escoria</a> by Julian Murgia.<p>Below you will find the preliminary schedule for GodotCon Brussels 2020, as well as a short description of the talks and the speakers. The order of the talks is still likely to change, and a few more talks may be added as we often get last minute proposals (especially from core contributors who tend to prefer making Pull Requests over preparing talks ;)).<p><strong>Note for GodotCon attendees:</strong> Always refer to the <strong><a href=https://godotengine.org/events>Events page</a></strong> when in doubt about specifics regarding the event (time, location). We’ll update this page in priority whenever there is new details.<p>For people who cannot attend GodotCon, do not despair―we plan to have a livestream on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/GodotEngineOfficial/live>Godot’s YouTube channel</a>, which will also be available in replay.<h2 id=godotcon-schedule>GodotCon schedule</h2><p>Note: This is currently an unordered list of talks we will have. This post will be updated with a plan for <em>when</em> each talk should be in coming days. This is also a preliminary schedule and there will likely be a few more talks planned until the event starts.<p><strong>Update 2020-01-27:</strong> Added talk by Aurélien C.<ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk:</strong> <em>Interior mapping with Godot</em><td>Pedro J. Estébanez (<a href=https://github.com/RandomShaper>RandomShaper</a>)</table><ul><li>Interior mapping is a technique to render interiors of 3D buildings in outdoor scenes without requiring any additional geometry. It tricks the eye into believing that there are rooms modeled behind the windows, but ceilings, floors and walls are actually created on the fly by a special custom pixel shader. This talk will show how this technique works and how to implement it in Godot.</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk:</strong> <em>Functional programming and applications on GDScript</em><td>George Marques (<a href=https://github.com/vnen>vnen</a>)</table><ul><li>Functional programming is trending nowadays, for a good reason. This talk highlights important points about functional programming, including advantages and disadvantages, brushes over some theoretical concepts, and shows how those can be applied when programming in GDScript.</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk:</strong> <em>Visual Vertical Slice - Not just concept art, but not yet a demo</em><td>Matejs Balodis</table><ul><li>Visual Vertical Slice is essentially a gameplay trailer, when there is no playable demo. It showcases the idea of the game. With this visual material in hand, you can present your project to the target audience to see their reaction, you can show this to your programmers, so that they have a better idea of how the game should work, you can use it to plan the production of your game, you can present it to potential investors and publishers to start a dialogue.</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Demo:</strong> <em>Making 3D adventure games with Godot</em><td>Paweł Fertyk (<a href=https://github.com/miskatonicstudio>miskatonicstudio</a>)</table><ul><li>Are you tired of 2D pixel art platformers? Try 3D adventure games! In this talk, Paweł will demonstrate the most effective ways of using Godot features to bring into existence 3D interactive worlds. Working example included!</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk:</strong> <em>Using a RigidBody or a KinematicBody for my character?</em><td>Marcel Admiraal (<a href=https://github.com/madmiraal>madmiraal</a>)</table><ul><li>It’s not obvious which type of PhysicsBody to use for your character. Even seasoned Godot users starting a new game struggle with this question. The problem is: It depends on the game you’re creating. In this talk we’ll explore the two key types of PhysicsBody: RigidBody and KinematicBody and look at some of the code behind their APIs. By the end you will be better placed to pick the right one for you for your next game.</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk:</strong> <em>Making Godot tutorials</em><td>Yann Burrett</table><ul><li>From sharing cool tricks you’ve found to teaching the fundamentals of Godot with an ongoing series of projects, making Godot tutorials helps all of us. This talk will use a blend of education theory and video production experience to give you the skills to make the best tutorials you can.</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk:</strong> <em>Reloading Escoria: making adventure games under Godot great again</em><td>Julian Murgia (<a href=https://github.com/StraToN>StraToN</a>)</table><ul><li>Escoria is a Libre framework for the creation of point-and-click adventure games with MIT-Licenced Godot Engine. Since its release, Godot Engine changed a lot at fast pace while Escoria code was still based on old Godot 1.x features. In this presentation, I’ll present the current state of Escoria and discuss the process of rewrite as a Godot Engine plugin. It’ll cover architecture and design, allowing adventure game creators to use Godot Engine as a full-featured editor for their adventure game.</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk:</strong> <em>Blockchain in games</em><td>Bojidar Marinov (<a href=https://github.com/bojidar-bg>bojidar-bg</a>)</table><ul><li>Blocks, chains, and buzz saws can be found in many games, but what does a buzzword such as a blockchain have to do with this? Join us as we demystify the ideas behind this technology and discuss their applications to a field most of you are likely already familiar with – games and game development. From a decentralized backend to microtransactions and autonomous organizations, the blockchain can be a powerful tool for developers, empowering them to build products in ways hardly possible before.</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk or demo:</strong> <em>Mystery…</em><td>Juan Liniestky (<a href=https://github.com/reduz>reduz</a>)</table><ul><li>As lead developer teasing us since last June with his progress on the Vulkan rendering backend, Juan won’t be able to get through GodotCon without talking the microphone and presenting some of the things he’s been doing lately. What exactly is yet to be determined, but he’s always good at improvising ;)</ul><li><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Talk:</strong> <em>Using Godot to make a 3D game as a hobbyist: getting the project done</em><td>Aurélien C. (<a href=https://twitter.com/RabbitEuro>Blue Rabbit game</a>)</table><ul><li>Using Godot to make 3D games is rewarding and doable for hobbyist solo devs without significant coding experience and with a limited amount of time. This presentation aims at showing how a few strategies may help you getting a project done, based on personal experience with an ongoing project.</ul><li><p>Expect a few more talks by core developers and Godot users added in coming days, as late submissions land into my mailbox. I might do a talk myself if I find any time to prepare one :)<li>Demos of current and upcoming games by several attendees.</ul><h3 id=the-speakers>The speakers</h3><p>Here’s some info about our GodotCon speakers.
